# Morphological-features-of-HFO
High-frequency oscillations (HFO), ripples (80-250 Hz), and fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) are strongly associated with epileptogenic tissues. Nevertheless, the healthy tissues can also generate HFO. We present an SVM classifier to separate HFO based on their morphological features, amplitude, duration, and spectral frequency.
