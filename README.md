# Morphological-features-of-HFO
High-frequency oscillations (HFO), ripples (80-250 Hz), and fast ripples (FR, 250-500 Hz) are associated with epileptogenic tissue. Nevertheless, the healthy tissue can also generate HFO. We present a RF classifier to separate HFO based on their morphological features, amplitude, duration, and spectral frequency.
